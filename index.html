        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m <strong>K Divya Kamath</strong>, a passionate student with a strong interest in technology and programming. 
          I have hands-on experience with programming languages like 
          <em>C, C++, Java, Python,</em> and <em>R</em>, as well as web development technologies such as 
          <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. 
          Outside of coding, I love <em>sketching, traveling, and photography</em>, which help me stay creative and inspired.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m eager to grow my skills and take on new challenges in the tech world. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
